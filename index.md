## Description

The goal of this class is to expose students to advanced programming
language ideas, including high-level programming abstractions, expressive
type systems and program analyses. We will develop these ideas as follows. 

1. First, we will see how the *lambda calculus* can be used to 
   distill essence of computation into a few powerful constructs, 
   and we will use it as a launching pad to study expressive type 
   systems, logics and analyses that can make precise predictions 
   about run-time behavior at compile time.

2. Second, we will study how this calculus yields 
   [Haskell](http://www.haskell.org), a *functional* 
   programming language that has been the incubator 
   for many recent PL advances. We will use Haskell 
   to learn about a variety of high-level programming 
   abstractions and techniques.

For more details see the [lecture](lectures.html) plan.

## Prerequisites

The class is mostly self contained. However, it will be *helpful* to have
some knowledge of basic discrete math, and it will be *essential*
that you enjoy programming and have a desire to learn the material.

## Integrity of Scholarship

University rules on integrity of scholarship will be strictly enforced. By
taking this course, you implicitly agree to abide by the UCSD Policy on
Integrity of Scholarship described [here](http://www-senate.ucsd.edu/manual/Appendices/app2.htm).

In particular, *"all academic work will be done by the student to whom
it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind."* You are expected
to do your own work on all assignments; there are no group projects in
this course.  You may (and are encouraged to) engage in **general**
discussions with your classmates regarding the assignments, but specific
details of a solution, including the solution itself, **must always be your own work**.
There will be graded assignments and exam in this course, as described below.
All exams are closed book; no implement other than your brain and a writing
instrument are to be used.

Incidents which violate the University's rules on integrity of scholarship
will be taken seriously.  In addition to receiving a zero (0) on the
assignment/exam in question, students may also face other penalties,
up to and including, expulsion from the University.  Should you have
any doubts about the moral and/or ethical implications of an activity
regarding the course, please see the instructor.

## Research

Your class work might be used for research purposes. For example, we may
use anonymized student assignments to design algorithms or build tools to
help programmers. Any student who wishes to opt out can contact the
instructor or TA to do so after final grades have been issued.
**This has no impact on your grade in any manner.**
